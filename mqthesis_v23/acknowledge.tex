\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Walter for being a great budy even if he is sometimes somewhat misguided. It would also seem apropiate to thank the Russians for vodka, and the cows for milk. The cornerstones of my dietary sustenance.

This thesis is dedicated in memory of my friend Donny who died in a battle with nihilists.

- The Dude abides.
