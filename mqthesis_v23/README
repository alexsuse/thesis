Macquarie University thesis LaTeX class file. 
====================================================================

VERSION 2.2

This is a LaTeX class file (and associated style files provided with
the package but falling under different copyright agreements) that
can be used in the preparation of Honours and PhD theses at 
Macquarie University, Sydney.

The files are distributed as a simple .tar.gz or .zip file.  Uncompress with
your favorite decompression utitlity, and you will be presented with
a "mqthesis" directory.

Within this directory you will find,

 o thesis.tex: the main TeX file 
 o abstract.tex, acknowledge.tex, listofpublications.tex, 
   listofsymbols.tex: frontmatter files
 o chap_intro.tex, chap_other.tex, chap_conclusion.tex, 
   chap_appendix.tex: sample chapter files
 o references.bib: sample BibTeX file

Edit and add to these as you see fit, don't forget to include extra files in
thesis.tex.

mqthesis.cls is the main class file that defines the look, and mqthesis.bst
defines the style of the bibliography (generated using the makebst), edit these
to tweak the look. 

mqthesis depends on a number of standard packages: {ccaption, quotchap, makeidx, 
natbib, tocbibind, amsmath,amsfonts,amssymb, graphicx, showkeys, ifpdf}, you may 
need to either install these packages or comment out the corresponding  \usepackage 
command.

Good luck. Don't Panic.

VERSION 2.3

The use of the hyperref package is now included in the class file mqthesis.cls. To 
make a pdf for online distribution use "foronline" in the options a la:
\documentclass[phd, titlesmallcaps, copyrightpage, foronline]{mqthesis}
In order to make a pdf version that doesn't have the coloured links leave out 
"foronline". Hyperref really only works for pdflatex, but will still add the colours 
for normal LaTeX if "foronline" is used.

Hyperref Options:
If you would like to change the colours of the links, open mqthesis.cls, and edit 
these options where ever you find them:
linkcolor=blueurlcolor=blue  % note that there are several places where urlcolor needs to be changedcitecolor=redanchorcolor=green

The "pagebackref" option for hyperref adds the hyperlinked page numbers at the end of 
each reference for the pages where that reference is cited. I like this since somebody 
reading the pdf version of your thesis can then easily see and jump to other places in 
your thesis that might be relevant. 
"pagebackref" is removed when "foronline" is not used.

Additionally PDF info is now requested in thesis.tex. This meta data can be viewed 
without opening the PDF file, and includes date of creation, author, title etc. and 
can include other things aswell.
Available fields are: /Title /Author /Creator /Producer /CreationDate /ModDate
			/Subject /Keywords 

Each chapter has been placed in it's own folder, this is mainly so that the figures
for each chapter is kept together, but it also reduces clutter.
